           <h1>HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON COMPUTING</h1>
           &nbsp;
           <h3><b>The Early Start of Computing Devices:          </b></h3>
           <h4><u>Abacus</u></h4>
           <h5>The Chinese developed the abacus some 4,000 years ago. There are metal rods with beads fastened to them hanging from a wooden rack. To perform arithmetic operations, the abacus operator moves the beads in accordance with predetermined patterns.          </h5>
           <h4><u>The Napier Bone</u></h4>
           <h5>Napier's Bones is a manually driven calculator that was created by John Napier. This device multiplied and divided nine distinct ivory strips, or bones, using numerals to mark them. Additionally, it was the first machine to perform calculations with decimal points.</h5>
           <h4><u>Pascaline</u></h4>
           <h5>The French mathematician and philosopher Biaise Pascal created Pascaline in 1642. It is believed to be the first automated and mechanical calculator. It was a wooden box that had wheels and gears within.</h5>
           <h4><u>Reckoner stepped or Leibniz wheel</u></h4>
           <h5>This device was developed in 1673 by the German mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who built upon Pascal's original idea. Because it employed fluted drums rather than gears, the digital mechanical calculator was dubbed the "stepped reckoner."</h5>
           <h4><u>Distinctive Mechanism</u></h4>
           <h5>Charles Babbage invented the Difference Engine around the beginning of the 1820s. It was a mechanical computer with basic calculation capabilities. It was a steam-powered calculator meant to solve logarithmic tables and other number tables.</h5>
            &nbsp;
           <h3><b>A History of Computers </b></h3>
           <h5>Calculations have been performed on machines for thousands of years, ever since the development of mankind. An abacus was among the first and most well-known devices. The first mechanical computer was then being developed in 1822 by Charles Babbage, the father of computers. After that, in 1833, he created the Analytical Engine, a general-purpose computer. It included an ALU, a few fundamental flow chart ideas, and the notion of integrated memory. </h5>
           <h5>Then, in the annals of computer history, almost a century later, we obtained our first general-purpose electronic computer. The acronym for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer is ENIAC. This computer was created by J. Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly.</h5>
            &nbsp;
           <h3><b>Generations of Computers (notable events)</b></h3>
           <h4><u>First Generation:</u></h4> <h5>This group encompassed the years 1940 through 1955. It was around this time that computer-readable machine language was created. Vacuum tubes were employed in the circuitry. They made use of magnetic drums to store memories. These were enormous, expensive, and intricate devices. Punch cards and batch operating systems were their main sources of dependence. Paper tape and magnetic tape were used as input and output technologies. ENIAC, UNIVAC-1, EDVAC, and so forth are a few examples. </h5>
           <h4><u>Second Generation:</u></h4> <h5> The term "second generation of computers" was first used to describe the years 1957–1963. COBOL and FORTRAN are used as assembly and programming languages in computers of the second generation. Transistors replaced vacuum tubes in this instance. As a result, the computers became quicker, more energy-efficient, and smaller. They also progressed from assembly to binary languages. IBM 1620, IBM 7094, CDC 1604, CDC 3600, and so on are a few examples. </h5>
           <h4><u>Third Generation:</u></h4> <h5> The invention of the integrated circuit was the defining feature of this era (1964–1971).  Many transistors are assembled into a single integrated circuit (IC), which lowers the cost of computers while also increasing their power. Compared to earlier models, these computers were more affordable, faster, more compact, and more dependable. High-level programming languages were used, including COBOL, PASCAL PL/1, and FORTRON-II to IV. </h5>
           <h4><u>Fourth Generation:</u></h4> <h5> The fourth generation of computers was introduced by the development of microprocessors. Fourth generation computers dominated the years 1971–1980. The programming languages used in this generation of computers were C, C++, and Java. We began making computers for home use with the STAR 1000, PDP 11, CRAY-1, CRAY-X-MP, and Apple II, for example </h5>
           <h4><u>Fifth Generation:</u></h4> <h5> These computers are still in use today, having been around since 1980. The world of computers is here to stay and will continue to do so. Artificial intelligence is the characteristic that defines this generation. This is becoming possible and has a great deal of potential for the future because of the usage of superconductors and parallel processing. Ultra Large Scale Integration, or ULSI, technology is used in computers of the fifth generation. These are the newest, most advanced computers available. Programming languages including C, C++, Java,.Net, and others are used. IBM, Pentium, Desktop, Laptop, Notebook, Ultrabook, and so on are a few examples </h5>

           <h1>Introduction to IT Basics</h1>
           <h4>Information technology, or IT for short, is the term used to describe how technology is used to process, share, organize, and store data. The IT sector is expanding swiftly as businesses rely more on technology and information management becomes essential. The book Introduction to IT is intended for those who are brand-new to the field of information technology and want to learn the basics. </h4>
           <h4>These days, information technology (IT) is a crucial component of any corporate plans. IT is important to many types of businesses, from large multinationals that manage databases and mainframe systems to small companies with a single computer. The simplest way to understand the reasons behind computer technology's widespread use in business is to examine how it is applied throughout the industry.</h4>
           &nbsp;
           <h2>COMPUTER NETWORKING</h2><h4>Interconnected computing equipment that may share resources and exchange data are referred to as computer networks. These networked devices exchange data over physical or wireless technologies using a set of guidelines known as communications protocols.</h4>
           &nbsp;
           <h2>HARDWARE</h2>
           <h4>Any word used to refer to the individual physical parts of an analog or digital computer is "computer hardware." The phrase "hardware" refers to a computing device's physical components as opposed to software, which is made up of programs or written, machine-readable instructions that specify what physical components should do and when.</h4>
           &nbsp;
           <h3><b>INTERNAL</b></h3><h4>the instructions provided by the program or operating system (OS) are processed or stored by internal components collectively.</h4>
           &nbsp;
           <h4><u>Motherboard</u></h4><h5>This is a printed circuit board that holds the central processing unit (CPU) and other essential internal hardware and functions as the central hub that all other hardware components run through.</h5>
           <h4><u>CPU</u></h4><h5>The CPU is the brain of the computer that processes and executes digital instructions from various programs; its clock speed determines the computer's performance and efficiency in processing data .</h5>
           <h4><u>RAM</u></h4><h5>RAM -- or dynamic RAM -- is temporary memory storage that makes information immediately accessible to programs; RAM is volatile memory, so stored data is cleared when the computer powers off.</h5>
           <h4><u>Hard drive</u></h4><h5> Hard disk drives are physical storage devices that store both permanent and temporary data in different formats, including programs, OSes, device files, photos, etc. </h5>
           &nbsp;
           <h3><b>EXTERNAL</b></h3> <h4>Peripheral components, also known as external hardware components, are external items connected to the computer to control input or output functions. These devices provide instructions to the software (input) or display results from its execution (output).</h4>
           &nbsp;
           <h4><u>Mouse</u></h4><h5> A mouse is a hand-held pointing device that moves a cursor around a computer screen and enables interaction with objects on the screen. It may be wired or wireless.</h5>
           <h4><u>Keyboard</u></h4><h5>A keyboard is an input device featuring a standard QWERTY keyset that enables users to input text, numbers or special characters.</h5>
           <h4><u>Microphone</u></h4><h5>A microphone is a device that translates sound waves into electrical signals and supports computer-based audio communications.</h5>
           <h4><u>Camera</u></h4><h5>A camera captures visual images and streams them to the computer or through a computer to a network device.</h5>
           &nbsp;
           <h2>SOFTWARE</h2>
           <h4>The best way to describe software is as a collection of instructions, or programs, that operate and carry out particular activities in response to user requests. Software controls every single task that a user desires to complete. There is a wide range of software for various tasks, all composed of binary language (ones and zeroes). </h4>
